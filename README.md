Webspider
IUT TP JS

=========
Description

This is a little web crawler (Alas not finished !) which starts from an URL and provides a simple GUI via Web browser.

A database (with SQLite3 [see database.js module]) should be used, but concurrent accesses problems and (too) large delays made ​​me give up using it.

=========
How to use

 - Start the crawler :
	node scrapper.js

 - Open the following URL in your web browser :
 	http://localhost:3000/

 - Push the button "start" (and wait... it may take a few moments) !
